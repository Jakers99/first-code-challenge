# JS Practice: Loops and Arrays

## Objective

Practice translating written instructions into JavaScript code. Focuses on variables, loops, arrays, and functions.

## Instructions

Inside the `client.js` are a set of steps written out in long form. Each numbered step needs to be implemented in JavaScript. Write your code beneath each step and turn in your completed code repo.

**Be sure to test regularly and use plenty of `console.logs()` to help find your errors!**
