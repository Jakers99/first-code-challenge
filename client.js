/*
1. Start with the number 42 and set that equal to a variable named 'myNumber'

2. Create condition logic to check if the myNumber is greater or equal to 53
2-1. If true, add 42 to 'myNumber'
2-2. If false, subtract 13 from 'myNumber'

3. Create a string that is set to 11, add it to 'myNumber'

4. Create an array called 'numberArray'. Loop through 'myNumber' (now a string!), and using charAt(), set numberArray[i] to each value from 'numberArray'

5. Remove the first and last values from 'numberArray'

6. Create a new variable. Loop **backwards** through 'numberArray' and concatenate each value from the array into the new variable (backwards, remember!)

7. parseInt() both the 'myNumber' and the new variable created in Step 6, ensure that both 'myNumber' and the new variable are set to these new parsed values

8. Add 'myNumber' and the new variable created in Step 6 together and store them in 'myNumber'

9. If the new value of 'myNumber' is less than 60, set 'myNumber' equal to 14. If not, check to see if it is equal to 2930, if it is, set 'myNumber' equal to 27. If neither of these are true, set the value to 2.

10. Create a while loop that runs 10 times and increments 'myNumber' by 1 each time through the loop.

11. Create a function that accepts an argument 'val'. The function should convert 'val' to a String, then drop the first character off the String, but only if there
is more than 1 character in the String. Return 'val' and set the variable 'myNumber' to the returned value.

12. Your answer should be a String value that equals 7. Is that what you got?
