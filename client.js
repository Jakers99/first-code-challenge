  { tile: 'K', score: 5 }
  { tile: 'Z', score: 10 }
  { tile: 'X', score: 8 }
  { tile: 'D', score: 2 }
  { tile: 'A', score: 1 }
  { tile: 'E', score: 1 }
```

4. 'Discard' the last tile in the myScrabbleTiles, and then 'draw' a new tile (add it to the array)
```
  { tile: 'F', score : 4 }
```

5. Write a function that returns the sum of all the scores of all the tiles in myScrabbleTiles
